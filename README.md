This project aims to analyze the cholera outbreak in a specific region by incorporating historical disease outbreak data, environmental and climatic variables. The goal is to develop a disease outbreak prediction model that leverages key factors such as temperature, precipitation, and sanitation. The study explores the relationship between these variables and cholera incidence, aiming to enhance early detection and response mechanisms.
