This project aims to analyze the cholera outbreak in a specific region by incorporating historical disease outbreak data and environmental and climatic variables. The goal is to develop a disease outbreak prediction model that leverages key factors such as temperature, precipitation, and sanitation. The study explores the relationship between these variables and cholera incidence, aiming to enhance early detection and response mechanisms.

Climate change is significantly influencing the spread and emergence of infectious diseases. Rising temperatures, fluctuating precipitation patterns, and increasing extreme weather events have created favorable conditions for disease vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents. This project aims to explore the relationship between climate variables and disease outbreaks using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, integrating real-time climate data, sanitation data, and disease reports to improve prediction accuracy.

This project has significant implications for global health, environmental policy, and disaster preparedness. By integrating AI and novel climatic variables into disease prediction, the study provides a more comprehensive approach to outbreak forecasting. It will aid governments, healthcare agencies, and researchers in proactive disease prevention and response planning.
